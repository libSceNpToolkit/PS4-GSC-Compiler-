## How To Compile

 - In the compiler section, select the "Browse" button for the GSC Project and select the root folder of your gsc menu source code
 - For the Output Path, hit the "Browse" button and pick any directory and give the file any name you would like (this is where it will store the compiled gsc file that can be injected)
